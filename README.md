### Description

I have had a lot of e-mail recently on how to make and reference c++ .dll's in VB to optimize their game engine. This is my solution. A 27 Page Tutorial!! Also a DX demo for the C++ .dll and how to reference demo in VB. Must See! Hard to describe fully. The tutorial takes you step-by-step with screen shots. This took a while to make so if it helps you or you like it please leave some feedback and vote. Thank You... -James-
